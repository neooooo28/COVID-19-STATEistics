Article: https://headwaterseconomics.org/tax-policy/fiscal-vulnerability-recreation-counties/

Data: https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/hospitals

This feature class/shapefile contains locations of Hospitals for 50 US states, Washington D.C., US territories of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, and Virgin Islands. 
The dataset only includes hospital facilities based on data acquired from various state departments or federal sources which has been referenced in the SOURCE field. 

Hospital facilities which do not occur in these sources will be not present in the database. 
The source data was available in a variety of formats (pdfs, tables, webpages, etc.) which was cleaned and geocoded and then converted into a spatial database. 

The database does not contain nursing homes or health centers. Hospitals have been categorized into children, chronic disease, critical access, general acute care, long term care, military, psychiatric, rehabilitation, special, and women based on the range of the available values from the various sources after removing similarities. 
In this update the TRAUMA field was populated for 172 additional hospitals and helipad presence were verified for all hospitals.

170 Rural Hospital Closures: January 2005 â€“ Present (128 since 2010).

Rural recreation counties are not only more exposed to risks of spread early in the pandemic, they are also less able to respond for a variety of reasons. Even before the global pandemic, many rural hospitals were already stretched thin, providing care to aging populations, victims of the opioid crisis, and families struggling from rural economic transitions. Rural hospital closures accelerated in the last decade and continue today.
